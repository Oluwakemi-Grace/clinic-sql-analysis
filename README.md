# clinic-sql-analysis
SQL case study project analyzing clinic performance and patient behavior


This project explores operational and patient data from a healthcare clinic using SQL. The goal was to uncover insights into doctor performance, patient behavior, and service efficiency through hands-on data analysis.

## Dataset

* **Source:** [Clinic Case Study on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizwanali324/clinic-case-study-dataset)
* **Tables Used:** `appointment`, `patient`, `doctor`, `prescription`, `medication`

---

## Objectives

* Understand patient demographics and visit trends
* Identify high-performing doctors
* Discover the most frequent health complaints
* Analyze clinic appointment volume and cancellation rates
* Correlate patient age with consultation outcomes
* Determine average consultation time and peak visit periods

---

## Tools Used

* MySQL

---

## Key SQL Tasks Completed

* Cleaned and joined 5 interrelated tables using `INNER JOIN`
* Calculated patient age from date of birth using `TIMESTAMPDIFF`
* Identified the most common diagnoses
* Analyzed doctor productivity based on appointment counts
* Evaluated cancellation rates and patterns
* Determined the busiest days and average daily visits

---

## Insights

* Depression is the most common diagnosis, especially among patients over 35 years old
* Dr. John Doe handled the highest number of appointments
* The clinic sees peak visits of 2 per day on average
* The oldest patient is Anna Lee, aged 56
* A total of 10 appointments were cancelled

---

## Learnings & Highlights

* Gained confidence in writing complex `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` queries
* Applied date functions to derive real-time age and time-based insights
* Improved query optimization and logical flow
* Practiced documenting SQL workflow for portfolio presentation
